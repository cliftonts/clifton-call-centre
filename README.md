# clifton-call-centre
A system for managing small scale call centre operations

Licensed under GPL V3.

Designed as a call management system for call centres performing telesales or market research. I decided to write this system when attempting to find such software for myself. Almost all the options charged for use and even then did not provide exactly what I required.

This is very much a work in progress so please do feel free to pitch in with both suggestions or coding.
At present it is a single user system but could possibly be expanded to manage small groups.


Instructions for use
--------------------

A database must be created for CCC to use, keep note of the username, password and database name.
Before first use it is important to run initialise.py. This will create the settings.cfg file and populate the database.
Next import.py should be used to import some data for calling.
