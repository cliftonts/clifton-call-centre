A system for managing small scale call centre operations

Licensed under GPL V3.

Designed as a call management system for call centres performing telesales or market research. I decided to write this system when attempting to find such software for myself. Almost all the options charged for use and even then did not provide exactly what I required.

This is very much a work in progress so please do feel free to pitch in with both suggestions or coding.
At present it is a single user system but could possibly be expanded to manage small groups.
